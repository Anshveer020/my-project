This project is a simple admin dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective was to
 create a clean, responsive layout using CSS Grid and implement a light/dark theme toggle feature. The HTML
  structure is divided into four key sections: a header that includes the dashboard title and a dark mode switch, 
  a sidebar navigation with links like Home, Users, and Settings, a main content area displaying a welcome message,
   and a footer showing copyright information. The layout uses CSS Grid to organize these sections effectively—three
    rows for the header, main content, and footer, and two columns inside the main content area for the sidebar and 
    main section. The styling is handled in a separate CSS file using CSS variables, which makes it easy to switch between 
    light and dark themes. By default, the page loads in light mode, and when the checkbox is toggled, JavaScript adds 
    or removes the “dark” class on the <body>, changing the color scheme dynamically without reloading the page. 
    Overall, the project demonstrates the use of semantic HTML tags, modern CSS layout techniques, theme customization
     using variables, and basic JavaScript for interactivity.
